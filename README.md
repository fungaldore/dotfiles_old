K3 Dotfiles - README
=======================

This is my dotfiles based on an old version of what they use at K3Integrations.
The setup is easy and there are many ways to customize it to your needs.

The current implementation is heavily inspired by
[thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) and
[thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop).

Install
-------
1.  Install your favorite [powerline font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
    and the [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) theme for your
    terminal program of choice. (On OSX you should use iTerm :wink: ).

1.  ~~`curl -fsS https://hub.k3integrations.com/k3/dotfiles/raw/master/install.sh | sh`~~

    `curl -fsS https://gitlab.com/calebatyapa/dotfiles/raw/master/install.sh | sh`

    (Be patient, particularly when vim is installing its plugins.
    The `YouCompleteMe` plugin takes a minute.)

1. That's it! :sunglasses:

1. NOTE: the other branches mostly have linux in mind with varying levels of
    complexity.
