K3 Dotfiles - README
=======================

This is the K3 dotfiles a number of developers at K3 use. The setup is easy and
there are many ways to customize it to your needs.

The current implementation is heavily inspired by [thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles)

Install
-------
1. `curl -fsS https://hub.k3integrations.com/k3/dotfiles/raw/master/install.sh | sh`

    (Be patient, particularly when vim is installing it's plugins.
    The `YouCompleteMe` plugin takes a minute.) 

2. That's it! :sunglasses:
