Caleb's Dotfiles - README
=======================

This sorta based on the dotfiles many of my coworkers used at my first job.
It is now highly customized.

The original implementation was heavily inspired by
[thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) and
[thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop).


Install
-------
1.  This, the more advanced version, uses special characters.  It won't look right
    if you don't have a good font.  I have three favorites I normally pick from.
    Source Code Pro from [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts),
    the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font,
    or if I have limited space [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/iosevka).
    As for themes, I currently prefer FogBell in vim.  It's a monochrome theme.
    If I want some color I usually gravitate toward the Solarized dark theme.
    This [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) theme is an
    excellent choice for iTerm on Mac.

1.  `curl -fsS https://gitlab.com/calebatyapa/dotfiles/raw/master/install.sh | sh`

    (Be patient, particularly when vim is installing its plugins.
    The `YouCompleteMe` plugin takes a minute.)

1.  That's it! :sunglasses:

## Notes
1.  The other branches are mostly experiments.
1.  Also included here is my preferred extensions and settings for VSCode.
1.  The games_list.md file contains some fun terminal ascii games I installed on Manjaro.
